MoveableType to WordPress Importer
----------------------------------

By Peter Snyder <snyderp@gmail.com>

This library moves content from a MoveableType export file (MTIF) to into a WordPress instance.  Currently handles the following items:

 * Tagging (from the MoveableType categories)
 * Assets (files and images) mentioned in those MTIF posts.  Items are copied over into their equivalent location on the WordPress install so, for example, an image located at http://oldexample.org/file.jpg will be copied and located at http://newexample.org/file.jpg
 * URL aliases, teasers, and body text
 * Post comments
 * Author associations, as long as WordPress users with the same name as those of each MoveableType author exists in wordpress
